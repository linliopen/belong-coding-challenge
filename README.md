Challenge Scenario:
As the platform/systems team, we have been asked to deliver a standard secure infrastructure on our AWS Cloud Account with following requirements -
Infra Requirements:
• A dedicated VPC with public and private subnets.
• An EC2 in the private subnet running httpd as a service. The timezone of the machine should be set to AEST.
• Download the file belong-test.html from S3 Bucket (belong-coding-challenge) in Sydney region and service it through httpd running as a service on the instance.
• Developers require terminal access to the EC2 for further configuration / administration.

Notes:
• IaC tool of choice is Cloudformation.
• Solution should be reliable, secure and would soon go into production.
We'll evaluate the submission on your problem solving approach, simplicity, code quality, and use of Cloud best practices within the solution.
Feel free to be creative and take liberties where you feel it will improve the deliverable!
